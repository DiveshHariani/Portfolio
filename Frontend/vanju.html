          <p>Description:Vulnerability in web applications allows malicious users to obtain unrestricted access to private and confidential information. SQL Injection vulnerabilities are particularly relevant, as web services frequently access a relational database using SQL commands. SQL injection is ranked at the top in web application attack mechanisms used by hackers to steal data from organizations. Hackers' can take advantages due to flawed design, improper coding practices, improper validations of user input, configuration errors, or other weaknesses in the infrastructure. Reference has said that researchers have proposed different techniques to provide a solution for SQLIAs (SQL Injection Attacks), but many of these solutions have limitations that affect their effectiveness and practicability.</p><br>

<p>Description:Generally, 6LoWPAN network is used for communication in IoT. All the 6LOWPAN nodes in the radio range of 6LoWPAN boarder router will start sending or reading data. There is no authentication present; hacker can take advantage of this situation and can be able to place his own sensor in the network which will start generating some random data at high speed and of huge size. This will result in Distributed Denial of Service [IoT-DDOS]. To avoid this problem, group management protocol has been proposed in this paper, “MAC-based Group Management Protocol-IoT” [MAC GMP-IoT].</p><br>

<p>Descripption:The financial market in itself is highly dynamic in nature and is affected by factors that are multifaceted. Human beings have the ability to monitor and assess several of these factors simultaneously. However, similar versatility is not easily achieved by software. Our aim is to create a analysis system that showcases some of this desired versatility, with the help of several algorithms and techniques, that will help capture more than one factors needed for efficient and thorough analysis of such a complex market. Moreover, the precision and robustness required to analyze the mammoth amount of financial data available is beyond human capacity. A combination of a holistic approach along with an added layer of efficiency will create a system capable of much more than mere analysis of the facts.</p><br>

  <li><strong>Project Title:</strong>Novel 3D Password</li>
  <p>Description:The most common method of authentication or protection against intrusion in a computer system is to use alphanumeric username and password. Choosing a strong password and protecting the chosen password has always been a popular topic among security researchers. Till date many techniques are proposed for protecting the passwords and tried to eliminate password hacking problem. Many biometric authentications have been proposed; however, users tend to resist using biometrics because of their intrusiveness and the effect on their privacy. In this paper presents and evaluate on the 3-D password. The 3-D password is a multifactor authentication scheme. Instead of depending on one factor add more security component which will make hackers and crackers job more difficult. In this paper we tried to enhance the password security by adding two more components to a password one is Challenge …</p>

<br><li><strong>Project Title:</strong>Car Parking Application</li>
<p>The ever increasing population has led to chaotic city traffic. As a result of the process of searching a parking lot becomes tedious. It is time consuming task leading to discomfort. The fuel consumption is on an increasing side due to such scenarios. The increase in vehicular traffic creates a negative impact on the environment. In the wake of smart city times these issues lead us to the need of a „smart‟ solution. In order to resolve these issues and satisfy the increasing demand for the parking areas, parking management organizations are trying to implement better and technologically advanced solutions. A cloud based smart parking application will enable real time parking availability monitoring and reservation thereby providing better services to the end users as well as reduce the workload of the parking administrator.</p>

  <li><strong>Project Title:</strong>Use of Internet of Things(IOT) in Healthcare.</li>

<p>Project Description:In today's world of connectivity, with the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) all entities are connected to each other by some communication means. The Internet of Things for the medical equipment will produce data that can go a long way in not only increasing equipment efficiency, but also patient health. The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly being recognized by industry and different services mainly in healthcare. This paper describes the various Internet of Things (IoT) enable devices and its practices in the area of healthcare for toddler, children, chronic care, monitoring of critical patients, operation theaters and medicine dispenser.</p>
  <p>This project is divided into 4 layers:Patients body network,Data Analytics layer,Private storage layer with block chaining and User Layer.</p>
